# Outfits-proposal
This is a proposal for my Outfits app

## What is it?
This is app would allow there to be buyers and sellers who each have their own accounts. As a seller you would create outfits that you find at thrift stores and then post them for people to buy. As a user you would be able to follow some of your favorite outfit creators and rate them. As well as send them a request for an outfit that they think you would like. You will also be able to buy outfits from them or recommend them to your friends.
